# A Rust Hardware Abstraction Library (HAL) for the Texas Instruments [AM64x series processors](https://www.ti.com/product/AM6442)

ðŸš§ **WORK IN PROGRESS** ðŸš§

I'm implementing this HAL for a project I want to develop. I'm likely only targeting a partial implementation long-term. Please reach out if you need support for additional peripherals or would like
to contribute.
